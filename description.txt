Task description:
Create a base react app, that holds list of products,
where each product has:
- product name
- product image
- product price (in USD)
Products can be hard coded in the code
 (don't need to manage the quantity, we can assume we
 always have them in the stock).

The app needs to have two pages:
- product list, lists the products from the stock
- product details, a page with all the details for
  the product and a custom form for entering payment
  info (card number, card expiration date, cvc number)

The app needs to be connected with a Stripe dev account.
The end user needs to be able to place payments,
that will be registered into the connected Stripe account.

***
The payment itself is not functional. As soon as I submit the payment,
 the button changes from PAY to PROCESSING
 and the flow does not continue, it stops there.
